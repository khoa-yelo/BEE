## 📖 Course Overview

During my PhD, I witnessed research moving toward systematic approaches to answer complex biological questions, largely driven by advances in high-throughput technologies (sequencing, imaging, wearables, etc...), novel computational methods (AI), and faster compute (GPU). Today, the ability to analyze data on the scale of hundreds of gigabytes—or even terabytes—has become a core skill for modern biologists. Yet, I’ve rarely seen courses designed to help biologists build these skills from the ground up. Many people get discouraged early, especially without the right support or guidance. That is the motivation for me to create this course.

Prerequisite
- Basic Programming (Python and/or R, bash)
- General knowledge of biology and genomics
