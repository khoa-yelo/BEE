## 📖 Course Overview

I've always been curious about biological systems and often find myself asking questions that requires looking at things from a systems or population-level perspective, as I want to understand how things fit into the bigger picture.

During my PhD, I realized that research is also moving toward this direction. More and more, researchers are taking systematic approaches to answer complex biological questions. I believe this shift is largely driven by advances in high-throughput technologies, computational methods, and scalable infrastructure.

Today, the ability to analyze data on the scale of hundreds of gigabytes—or even terabytes—has become a core skill for modern biologists. Yet, I’ve rarely seen courses designed to help biologists build these skills from the ground up. Many people get discouraged early, especially without the right support or guidance. That’s the motivation behind this course.

So let’s roll up our sleeves, dive into large and messy datasets, and uncover new biology together.

Prerequisite
- Basic Programming (Python and/or R, bash)
- General knowledge of biology and genomics
