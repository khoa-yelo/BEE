How many times have you tried to run a software and it didn't work?

Common pains:
    - It works on my laptop
    - Packages required not installed
    - Dependence on HPC (module load ...)
    - Jupter Notebook, VSCode not available on HPC

## Login to SCG

```
ssh <SUNETID>@login.scg.stanford.edu -L <PORT>:localhost:<PORT>
```

The `-L <PORT>:localhost:<PORT>` is called ssh tunneling, allow one to run Jupyter Notebook and VSCode on your browser! 

Pick a port in range 20,000 to 30,000 (e.g. 23456)

## Package manager

Micromamba


Navigate to directory you want to save env

```
mkdir envs
cd envs
```

Download micromamba

```
curl -Ls https://micro.mamba.pm/api/micromamba/linux-64/latest | tar -xvj bin/micromamba
```

Add init to bash profile
```
./bin/micromamba shell init -s bash -r <PATH>  # this writes to your .bashrc file
# <PATH> is where micromamba will save all the packages
# sourcing the bashrc file incorporates the changes into the running session.
# better yet, restart your terminal!
source ~/.bashrc
```

## Container 

## Setup your bash profile
